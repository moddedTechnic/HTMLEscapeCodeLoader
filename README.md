# HTMLEscapeCodeLoader
Downloads HTML escape codes to CSV file (debug table also available)

Run `get_html_escape_codes.py` to refresh `html_escape_codes.csv` and `out.html`.
`out.html` is the debug output - open in a web browser to view a formatted table of downloaded escape codes.
`html_escape_codes.csv` is the main output. The first column is the numerical code, the second column is the text-based code if there is one, otherwise `""` and the third column is the name of the character. All codes are escaped with `""`.
